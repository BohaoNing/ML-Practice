They point out that we need the signal to ﬂow properly in both directions: in the forward direction when making predictions, and in the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients.

    "\n",
    "    No, all weights should be sampled independently; they should not all have the same initial value. One important goal of sampling weights randomly is to break symmetry: if all the weights have the same initial value, even if that value is not zero, then symmetry is not broken (i.e., all neurons in a given layer are equivalent), and backpropagation will be unable to break it. Concretely, this means that all the neurons in any given layer will always have the same weights. It's like having just one neuron per layer, and much slower. It is virtually impossible for such a configuration to converge to a good solution."

    "\n",
    "    ReLU remains a good default for simple tasks: it’s often just as good as the more sophisticated activation functions, plus it’s very fast to compute, and many libraries and hardware accelerators provide ReLUspeciﬁc optimizations. ReLU is usually a good default for the hidden layers, as it is fast and yields good results. Its ability to output precisely zero can also be useful in some cases (e.g., see Chapter 17). Moreover, it can sometimes benefit from optimized implementations as well as from hardware acceleration. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    If you care a lot about runtime latency, then you may prefer leaky ReLU, or parametrized leaky ReLU for more complex tasks. The leaky ReLU variants of ReLU can improve the model's quality without hindering its speed too much compared to ReLU.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For large neural nets and more complex problems, GLU, Swish and Mish can give you a slightly higher quality model, but they have a computational cost. Swish is probably a better default for more complex tasks, and you can even try parametrized Swish with a learnable β parameter for the most complex tasks. Mish may give you slightly better results, but it requires a bit more compute. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For deep MLPs, give SELU a try, but make sure to respect the constraints listed earlier. If you have spare time and computing power, you can use cross-validation to evaluate other activation functions as well.\n",

    "    The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) can be useful in the output layer if you need to output a number in a fixed range (by default between –1 and 1), but nowadays it is not used much in hidden layers, except in recurrent nets.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    The sigmoid activation function is also useful in the output layer when you need to estimate a probability (e.g., for binary classification), but it is rarely used in hidden layers (there are exceptions—for example, for the coding layer of variational autoencoders; see Chapter 17).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The softplus activation function is useful in the output layer when you need to ensure that the output will always be positive. The softmax activation function is useful in the output layer to estimate probabilities for mutually exclusive classes, but it is rarely (if ever) used in hidden layers."

Then it will slow down and come back, accelerate again, overshoot again, and so on. It may oscillate this way many times before converging, so overall it will take much longer to converge than with a smaller momentum value."
